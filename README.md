# ALU-Verification-using-System-Verilog

## Introduction
This project implements a SystemVerilog-based verification environment for an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU). The goal is to ensure the ALU operates correctly under all specified conditions by:
- Generating constrained-random test stimuli
- Checking outputs against a reference model
- Measuring functional and code coverage

## Key Features
✔ Modular Testbench Architecture (Generator, Driver, Monitor, Scoreboard, Reference Model)
✔ Transaction-based verification (Mailbox communication between components)
✔ Functional Coverage (Tracking opcodes, operands, flags, and corner cases)
✔ Protocol Checking (Handling invalid inputs, multi-cycle operations)
✔ Automated Result Comparison (Scoreboard vs. Golden Reference)
